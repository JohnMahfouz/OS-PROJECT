# OS_PROJECT – Educational Operating System (FOS)

An educational operating system developed as part of the Operating Systems Course (CSW355) at Ain Shams University. Based on MIT's [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/xv6.html), this project provides hands-on experience with core OS concepts including memory management, virtual memory, and process scheduling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project is structured around several key milestones, each covering essential operating system concepts:

- ✅ **Kernel Heap Management**  
  Implemented `kmalloc()`, `kfree()`, and virtual-to-physical address translation mechanisms.

- ✅ **User Memory Management**  
  Implemented `malloc()`, `free()`, and integrated dynamic memory allocation strategies.

- ✅ **Page Fault Handling**  
  Developed a page fault handler with the **Modified Clock Algorithm** for page replacement and buffering optimizations.

- ✅ **Virtual Memory & Swap Management**  
  Memory swapping between RAM and secondary storage with paging support.

- ✅ **Process Scheduling**  
  CPU scheduling for multi-process execution using customizable algorithms.
