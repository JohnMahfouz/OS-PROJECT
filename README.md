# OS_PROJECT
implementation of the FOS project, an educational operating system developed as part of the Operating Systems Course (CSW355) at Ain Shams University. The project is based on MIT's xv6 and has been adapted to provide hands-on experience with memory management, process scheduling, and virtual memory.

Project Overview : 
The project is divided into multiple milestones, covering key operating system concepts such as:

âœ… Kernel Heap Management â€“ Implementing kmalloc(), kfree(), and virtual-to-physical address translation. âœ… User Memory Management â€“ Implementing malloc(), free(), and dynamic memory allocation strategies. âœ… Page Fault Handling â€“ Handling page faults and implementing the Modified Clock Algorithm for page replacement. âœ… Virtual Memory & Swap Management â€“ Managing memory swapping between RAM and secondary storage. âœ… Process Scheduling â€“ Implementing CPU scheduling algorithms for multi-process execution.

Features Implemented : 
Dynamic memory allocation with First Fit and Best Fit strategies Virtual-to-physical memory translation Page replacement using Modified Clock Algorithm Kernel & user heap memory management Page fault handler with buffering optimizations Process scheduling for multitasking

Contributions & References : This project follows the structure of the Ain Shams University FOS course. Special thanks to Dr. Mahmoud Hossam and Dr. Ahmed Salah for maintaining the course materials.
